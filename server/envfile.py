"""Reads and writes the allowlisted secrets in the project's `.env` file.

Responsibility: let the school app store its AI key in `.env` (never in the data file) and read it back.
Fits in: server/app.py serves GET and PUT /api/keys through EnvFile; the browser sync engine
fills empty key fields from it. Uses python-dotenv for parsing and for updating single lines.

Invariants:
- Only names in ENV_KEYS can be read or written; any other name is an EnvError.
- A value is one line without control characters and at most MAX_VALUE_LENGTH characters.
- Writing an empty value removes the key. Unrelated lines in the file are kept untouched.
- The file has mode 0600 (owner only) after every write, whether it was created here or already existed.
  Values are never logged or put into error messages.
