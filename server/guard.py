"""Request guard: the security boundary of the local school-app server.

Responsibility:
    Pure, side-effect-free decisions about whether a request may be served:
    the Host header check (DNS rebinding defence), the Origin check and the
    JSON content-type check for writes, and the static file allowlist that maps
    a raw URL path onto a real file inside the project root.

Where it fits:
    server/app.py calls these functions for every request. This module imports
    nothing from the rest of the server, and performs no I/O beyond the
    stat/resolve calls needed to follow symlinks in `resolve_static`.

Invariants:
    * `resolve_static` never returns a path outside the resolved project root,
      and never returns a path that the allowlist would refuse by name, either
      as requested or after symlinks are followed.
    * Markdown is refused everywhere except prompt templates under apps/**/prompts/.
    * Every refusal is a plain `False` / `None`; callers turn that into 403 or
      404. Nothing here raises for hostile input.
