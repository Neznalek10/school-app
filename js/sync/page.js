/**
 * Page entry for syncing: starts the engine on the real browser objects.
 *
 * Responsibility: be the only sync file that touches window, localStorage and sessionStorage. It builds the
 * API client, hands everything to startSync and swallows every error, so a problem in sync (storage blocked,
 * server odd, bug) can never stop the page it is loaded on.
 * Where it fits: loaded as a non-blocking `<script type="module">` by index.html, apps/french/index.html and
 * apps/vocab/index.html, after the app's own script; it uses js/sync/engine.js and js/sync/client.js.
 * Invariant: this module never throws and never rejects; failures are reported with console.warn only.
