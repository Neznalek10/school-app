/**
 * Sync engine: keeps the browser's tracked localStorage keys and the server's data file in step.
 *
 * Responsibility: on start, decide whether this browser or the data file is newer (restore with one
 * reload, save, or just adopt the revision); afterwards watch tracked storage writes, save them after a
 * short debounce, when the page is hidden, and (small bodies only) on pagehide; keep AI keys out of the
 * data file by moving them to .env; resolve revision conflicts without losing the loser's data.
 * Where it fits: js/sync/page.js starts it on every page; js/views/account.js reads `syncState`, calls
 * syncNow and forgetKey. It uses js/sync/snapshot.js (pure storage/entry helpers) and a client made by
 * js/sync/client.js. Everything it touches (storage, client, window, session storage, timers) is passed to
 * startSync, so there are no globals at import time and tests run it with fakes.
 *
 * Invariants:
 * - Nothing is patched and nothing is sent unless /api/status answers with mode 'file'. The hooks go in
 *   before the startup network calls (they only count changes then) and come out again when startup fails
 *   or the page reloads.
 * - The wrapped Storage methods act only when `this` is the watched storage object; they are installed on
 *   the storage's prototype (never assigned on an instance, which would create an item named 'setItem').
 * - The engine's own writes (restore, fillSecrets, forgetKey) are muted, so they never mark data dirty.
 * - The data file never receives an AI key: every push is redacted first, and the key goes to .env. At
 *   startup .env wins over a different key held by this browser; keys for other providers stay in the
 *   browser only and survive a restore and forgetKey.
 * - Anything that would overwrite local data first saves it to data/conflicts/.
 * - Errors never reach the app's own code: hooks and handlers catch and report through `syncState.error`.
